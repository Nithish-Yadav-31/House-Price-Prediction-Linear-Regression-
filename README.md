# House-Price-Prediction-ML-Internship-Project-

• The problem statement is depends on **prediction algorithm**.

• The Given dataset contains information about **New and Old Houses** in USA.

• The Dataset contain **80 different variables** in different datatypes.

• The **Target variable** in dataset is **Sale Price**.

• There are 79 other variables to be analyzed with target variable.

• Use **only machine learning algorithms** to make prediction.

• **Avoid over-fitting** of the model.

• Understand the relation in between the independent variables as well.

• Try to **convert everything as numbers** before feeding to model.

• Analyze the dataset properly and **check for missing values**.

• Because of many independent variables be sure with what variable you are relating to.

• Use **EDA** Technique to understand and filter dataset.

• Choose only variables that have relationship with Target variable before feeding to model .

• The model should predict the price of each different house.

• Improve the **model accuracy over 77%**

## The Description of the dataset is included in the repostiory.
